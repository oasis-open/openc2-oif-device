This GitHub public repository [openc2-oif-device](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-device) was created at the request of the [OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

## <a id="purposeStatement"></a>Statement of Purpose

OpenC2 Integration Framework (OIF) is a project that will enable developers to create and test OpenC2 specifications and implementations without having to recreate an entire OpenC2 ecosystem.

OIF consists of two major parts. The "orchestrator" which functions as an OpenC2 producer and the "Device" which functions as an OpenC2 consumer.

This particular repository contains the code required to set up an OpenC2 Device. The Orchestrator repository can be found [here](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator). Due to port bindings it is recommended that the orchestrator and the device not be run on the same machine.

The OIF Device was created with the intent of being an easy-to-configure OpenC2 consumer that can be used in the creation of reference implemetations. To that end it allows for the addition of multiple actuators, serializations, and trasnportation types.
