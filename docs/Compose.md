# Docker Compose
- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
-  For more information that available in this readme see the [Docker Compose Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Overview
- Three basic steps:
	1. Create or modify available containers so that they are easily repoduced
		- All available conainers are on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/)
	2. Define the services (containers from previous step) in the compose file (orchestrator-compose.yaml and device-compose.yaml)
	3. Start the compose with `docker-compose up` to start and run the app's containers
